            </p> 
            <p>Make sure that you choose the right size battery. When you need to buy a new car battery, make sure that you choose the one that's the perfect fit and type for your specific car. Car batteries are available in a lot
                 of different sizes and types, so you need to choose one that works with your particular car’s make and model.</p>
            <h3>Why Should I Change my Battery?</h3>
            <p>Car batteries wear out over time, and extremely hot or cold weather can speed up a good battery’s demise. The cold is commonly thought of as a killer of batteries, but that's because the it takes more exertion. Typically these
                 batteries lose strength before the winter, and then finally fail when trying to start up the engine in the cold.</p>
            <h3>How Does a Car Battery Work?</h3>
            <p>A battery is one of the most important parts of your car. Without it, a car cannot move at all. The battery works by
                 taking an electric current and using it to power the motor to start the engine, which then gets the car going.</p>
            <p>The cathode and anode are the respective positively and negatively charged sides of the battery, and the electrolyte is a buffer between the two. The chemical reactions inside cause a buildup of electrons in the anode. Just like magnets, these similarly charged 
                particles repel one another, but are blocked from moving to the other side of the battery by the electrolyte. </p>
            <p>
                That means that negatively charged particles need to travel through something external
                 to the battery to circumvent the electrolyte and reach the cathode, where particles carry a positive charge.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s where your car comes in. Your vehicle’s electrical system provides a path for electrons to travel when the
                 positive and negative terminals are hooked up, and this travel provides electrical current to your vehicle.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Identify a Faulty Battery</h3>
            <p>There are several ways that you can figure out how to identify a faulty battery. Check its age. The bottom line is that older batteries have many more issues than younger batteries and are more likely to fail. If your battery has been in your car for several years, it's probably best to make the assumption that it needs to be changed. Batteries wear down over time due to things like multiple cycles of discharging.
                 They can also break down over time if they’re constantly exposed to extreme temperatures or temperature changes.</p>
            <p>Another sign that it's time to get a new battery is if the battery is slow to start. This means that when you get into the car and turn
                 the key, the engine doesn't turn over. It could also make a strange sound before it finally does turn over.</p>
            <h3>How Long Does an Auto Battery Last?</h3>
            <p>
                Most people ask,<a href="#"> How long does an auto battery last?</a> because they want to be prepared ahead of time. In general, car batteries last anywhere from three to five years.
                 There are several factors that will determine how long your battery will last.
            </p>     
            <p>
                If you drive in extreme temperatures, the exposure to those temps will have a huge impact on the life of the battery. If you're constantly on the road taking the car
                 for long trips, that's another thing that could affect your battery's lifespan. If your alternator and drive belt are starting to break down, those are additional issues that could shorten your battery’s life span.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may have reached the five-year point with no issues. This is because many of the latest batteries are designed to work right up until the point that they fail. This means that you're unlikely to get a lot of
                 warning signs before the battery dies. This could be particularly bad if you’re nowhere near help.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most batteries last 3-5 years. If your battery is 4 years old or older, your car or truck battery is at risk. If you’re worried, AutoZone offers free battery testing and charging service to check out your current battery. We'll even take care of the old one with battery recycling. When it’s time for a replacement, we’ve got the right battery
                 to get you back on the road. It's safe to assume that after five years you need to get a new battery.
